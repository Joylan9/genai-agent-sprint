## 🚀 Project Vision

This repository documents my structured journey toward mastering:

- Generative AI (GenAI)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic AI Systems
- AI Backend Architecture
- Production-Ready AI Engineering

The objective is not to build a simple chatbot, but to deeply understand, design, and implement scalable AI systems from scratch.

This project represents my transition from:

> AI Tool User → AI System Builder → AI Engineer
