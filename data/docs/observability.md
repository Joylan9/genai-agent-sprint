# Observability and Monitoring

Monitoring stack:
- Prometheus: Collects latency, success/failure counts, and resource usage.
- Grafana: Visualizes performance metrics and alerts.
- Structured Logging: JSON logs for easy parsing by ELK/Splunk.
- Tracing: Request IDs cross-reference logs and database traces.
