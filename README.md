GenAI & Agentic AI System Builder Sprint
Overview

This repository documents my structured deep dive into Generative AI and Agentic AI system development.

The goal of this project is not to build a simple chatbot, but to design and implement a production-style AI backend architecture including:

Local LLM integration (Ollama + LLaMA3)

Prompt engineering fundamentals

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Vector search systems

Tool-using AI agents

Modular backend structure using FastAPI

Enterprise-style AI architecture design

Why This Project?

This project exists to transition from:

AI tool user → AI system builder

It focuses on understanding how AI systems work internally, not just using APIs or prompting interfaces.
